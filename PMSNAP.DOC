 Introduction
 -------------
 This is the documentation for PMSnap. We recommend that you read it!
 At least have a look at the "Recommendations" and "Environment
 variable" sections.
 To quickly see some of PMSnaps unique capabilities try the following:

 1:
   - start PMSnap
   - place a window so that some parts of the window is outside the
     screen; select "Window" from PMSnap "Capture" menu, and point
     and click at the previously positioned window
   - PMSnap should now have copied the entire window, including the
     parts of the window outside the screen
 2:
   - select "Window" from PMSnap "Capture" menu, and point and click at
     the Desktop window
   - PMSnap shows a information dialog (how big the window is), and you
     can answer "Yes"
   - PMSnap should now have copied the entire Desktop window, including
     the parts of the window outside the screen (titlebar and border)
 3:
   - select "Area of Screen" from PMSnap "Capture" menu, and PMSnap
     shows a crosshair
   - now press "Ctrl+M", and you get a magnifying pointer in the middle
     of the crosshair
   - to select a area of the screen, press mouse button 1, keep mouse
     button 1 down, and drag the tracking rectangle, so that it covers
     the area you want to capture (if you want to toggle magnifying
     pointer on/off, press "Ctrl+M")
   - release mouse button 1
   - PMSnap should now have copied the area you selected
   
 Features
 ---------
 - Screen capture
 - Window capture (also windows outside screen)
 - Window interior capture (also windows outside screen)
 - Area capture (with or without magnifying pointer)
 - Delayed capture
 - 8 and 24 bit colour support
 - Palette Manager support
 - Save to file (OS/2 2.x and Windows 3.x, 8 and 24-bit bitmaps)
 - Copy to clipboard (including palette)
 - Paste from clipboard (including palette)

 Menus
 ------
 "File":
 - Use "Save as..." to open a save dialog to save the bitmap
   to a file. (OS/2 2.x and Windows 3.x, 8 and 24-bit bitmaps.)
   Disabled if nothing to save.

   - You use the "Save Bitmap" dialog to name and save a new file.
     Give a name and press "Save" button, to cancel press "Cancel"
     button.
     Note 1: If file exists, the previous file is overwritten!
     Note 2: PMSnap forces a "BMP" file extension!

 - "Exit" quits PMSnap and returns you to OS/2.
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+X or F3)

 "Edit":
 - "Copy" bitmap to clipboard. If your display driver supports
   Palette Manager, and if "Palette options" "Copy/Paste palette to/from
   clipboard", is grayed, a dialog asks whether you want to copy
   palette to clipboard or not.
   Disabled if nothing to copy.
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+Insert)

 - "Paste" bitmap from clipboard. If your display driver supports
   Palette Manager, and if "Palette options" "Copy/Paste palette to/from
   clipboard," is grayed, a dialog asks whether you want to paste
   palette from clipboard or not.
   Disabled if nothing to paste.
   (shortcut key: Shift-Insert)

 "Capture":
 - "Cancel Capture" cancels a started (but not yet finished) capture.
   Disabled when you are not capturing anything.
   (shortcut key: ESC)

 - "Window" captures a specified window on the screen.
   PMSnap first changes the pointer to a red pointer pointing on a
   mini-window. Select the window you want to capture by pointing
   at, and clicking mouse button 1.
   If "Options" "Allow full capture" checked and if window size exceeds
   screen size (either vertically, horizontally or both) PMSnap displays
   a dialog where you can choose if you want to continue or not.
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+W)

 - "Window Interior" captures a specified window interior on the
   screen. PMSnap first changes the pointer to a red pointer pointing
   on a mini-window. Select the window interior you want to capture by
   pointing at, and clicking mouse button 1.
   If "Options" "Allow full capture" checked and if window interior size
   exceeds screen size (either vertically, horizontally or both) PMSnap
   displays a dialog where you can choose if you want to continue or not.
   Note: Some windows (ex. dialog windows) do not have a client area,
   and PMSnap is not able to determine what you want to capture, so
   PMSnap captures the entire window.
   Note 2: "Win-OS/2 window" sessions are captured without their border
   but for example titlebars and menubars are captured.
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+I)

 - "Screen" captures the entire screen.
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+S)

 - "Area of Screen" captures a specified area of screen.
   PMSnap first changes the pointer to a crosshair (alternatively with
   a magnifying pointer in the centre of the crosshair, see "Options"
   for details).
   Place the pointer where you want to start your capture; press
   mouse button 1 (keep it down); drag the crosshair so that the
   tracking rectangle covers the area you want to capture;
   release mouse button 1. You may alternatively use cursor (arrow)
   keys for precise tracking.
   Pressing backspace-button during tracking gives you the
   opportunity to restart capture. ESC cancels capture.
   Ctrl+M toggles magnifying pointer on/off.
   Note: You can change the settings for the tracking rectangle in
   the Options-dialog; whether the tracking rectangle itself is part
   of the capture area or not. 
   If you use "Area of Screen" capture on animated areas (the window
   is repainted while the crosshair is on top of that window), parts
   of the crosshair, are sometimes left in the window. If you want to
   get rid of this garbage just resize, hide or minimize that window
   (this causes the window to be repainted). We recommend you use
   "Window" or "Window Interior" capture on animated areas, and then
   when you have the captured window in PMSnap, you can use "Area of
   Screen" to capture detailed parts of that window. 
   (shortcut key: Ctrl+A)

 "Display":
 - "Fit to window" If unchecked; shows the bitmap in its actual
   size. If picture bigger than PMSnap client area, use scrollbars
   to view hidden parts.
   If checked; shows the bitmap stretched (keeping its proportions)
   to fit the PMSnap client area.
   (shortcut key: F4)

 - "Options..." opens a "Options" dialog:

   - "Hide PMSnap during capture"; you can choose between:
     - "Instantly after choosing capture method"
     - "Only during capture" PMSnap is hidden during capture,
       but only during capture (not when selecting target or
       during delayed capture count-down).
     - "PMSnap is not hidden during capture"

   - "Sound after capture":
     - not checked; no sound after capture.
     - checked; gives a note sound when capture is ready.

   - "Capture delayed" ?? "sec." where you can specify a delay
     time between 0 and 60 seconds. The delay starts after target
     of capture has been chosen. If PMSnap is not hidden during
     capture, a count-down is shown in the titlebar/icon text.
     Note: If you choose a value greater than 60, the delay will
     be reset to 0.

   - "Allow full capture"
     - not checked; windows outside the screen will be clipped.
       If you for some reason do not like PMSnap to capture windows
       outside the screen. We recommend you do NOT use this.
     - checked; windows outside the screen will be captured.
       Note: We recommend you use this.

   - "Area capture":
     - "Magnifying pointer":
       - not checked; during area capture PMSnap changes the default
         pointer to a crosshair.
       - checked; during area capture PMSnap changes the default
         pointer to a crosshair and includes a magnifying pointer in
         the centre of the crosshair.
       During area capture Ctrl+M toggles magnifying pointer on/off.
       (The magnifying pointer size is the size of your icons. Sorry,
        it is not possible to make it bigger.)

     - "Magnify by" where you can specify the degree of magnification.
       Currently you can choose between 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5. You can not
       write anything to the spinner control, you must use the spinner
       arrows to change the value (alternatively use arrow-keys).
       Note: This control is disabled if "Magnifying pointer" control
       is not checked.

   - "Include rectangle":
     This specifies which parts of the tracking rectangle are included
     to the capture area.
     - "Left" 
       - not checked; do not include left side of rectangle.
       - checked; include left side of rectangle.
     - "Top"
       - not checked; do not include top side of rectangle.
       - checked; include top side of rectangle.
     - "Right"
       - not checked; do not include right side of rectangle.
       - checked; include right side of rectangle.
     - "Bottom"
       - not checked; do not include bottom side of rectangle.
       - checked; include bottom side of rectangle.

   - "OK": Changes made to the Option dialog are accepted.

   - "Cancel": Changes made to the Option dialog are cancelled.

 - "Palette options..." opens a "Palette Manager Options" dialog:
   Disabled if your display driver do not support Palette Manager.

   - "Palette Manager":
     - "Copy/Paste palette to/from clipboard":
       - not checked; Palette is not copied/pasted to/from clipboard.
       - grayed; A dialog always asks if you want to copy/paste the
         palette to/from clipboard.
       - checked; Palette is always copied/pasted to/from clipboard.

     - "Aggressive on palette"
       For changes to take effect, either restart PMSnap (or try
       opening closing a few folders on the desktop).
       - not checked; When painting, PMSnap refreshes the palette
         locally. Other applications using the palette affects (less).
         Note: We recommend you use this.
       - checked; When painting, PMSnap refreshes the palette
         globally. Other applications using the palette affects (more).
         Note: We recommend you do NOT use this.

   - "OK": Changes made to the Palette Manager Options dialog are
     accepted.

   - "Cancel": Changes made to the Palette Manager Options dialog
     are cancelled.

 "Help":
 - Standard "Help" menu. Help currently disabled.

 - "About PMSnap..." shows a product information dialog.

 System menu:

 Environment variable
 ---------------------
 PMSnap saves its settings in its own ini-file. For the program
 to know where to look for this file, PMSnap uses a environment
 variable: PMSNAP_INI. This variable specifies the filename
 (including full path) that PMSnap should use for storing its
 options. If this environment variable is not set, PMSnap will
 create the file PMSNAP.INI in the current directory and store
 its information there. I recommend that you put the line:

 SET PMSNAP_INI=C:\OS2\PMSNAP.INI

 in your CONFIG.SYS (Of course, you can use any other path or
 filename that you want). By doing this you avoid multiple copies
 of PMSNAP.INI scattered around your hard drive.
 You will have to reboot before this line will take effect.
 
 Starting the program
 ---------------------
 To start PMSnap, double click on the program object.
 
 Program requirements
 ---------------------
 To use PMSnap, you must be running OS/2 2.0 (or later), and of
 course Workplace Shell as your shell. 
 
 Recommendations
 ----------------
 - If you use PMSnap feature capturing windows outside the screen, 
   we recommend you use OS/2 system settings "Hide window":
   "System setup"
     "System - settings"
       "Window"
         "Minimize button behaviour"
           "Hide window"
   This is to make sure that you will not lose any icons (minimized
   windows), especially "Win-OS/2 window" icons.
   If you however, lose any icons, you may restore the window
   from "Window List" (press Ctrl+Esc, or both mouse buttons to
   activate "Window List"). 
 - We recommend you do not have "Win-OS/2 window" sessions open
   (visible), while doing capture on windows outside the screen.
   Especially do not capture "Win-OS/2 window" sessions outside the
   screen. (Win-OS/2 window sessions will not update (paint) their
   sessions fast enough.)

 Troubleshooting
 ----------------
 - When you capture windows outside the screen, some windows are
   not (fully) repainted:
   - Sorry! there is nothing you can do about this. We decided not
     to implement any "artificial" delay, since some windows need
     several seconds to repaint (and there is no way for PMSnap to
     know when a window has finished repainting).
 - Recovering "lost" windows/icons: 
   - If for some reason you "lose" any window or icon during capture
     of windows outside the screen, you may choose the "lost"
     window/icon from Workplace Shell "Window List" and cascade
     the window back to the visible area (select program, press
     mouse button 2, choose "Cascade").

 Warranty:
 --------
 There is no warranty, expressed or implied, for PMSnap.

 Registering
 ------------
 If you find that you like PMSnap and desire to continue using it,
 you should become a registered user. Registration confers on you
 a number of benefits:

 - You will receive the latest version of PMSnap.

 - You are automatically registered for the next version of PMSnap
   when it becomes available. You will be notified of all new
   releases thereafter as they happen.

 - Registered users will receive priority service on technical
   assistance through Internet e-mail or by paper letter.
   Anyone and everyone may contact us however.

 - You will also receive full printed documentation for PMSnap. 

 - Plus, you get the piece of mind to know that you have helped
   support the shareware concept which is dedicated to bringing
   quality software at low prices to as many people as possible.
   Shareware authors devote many, many hours of their time creating
   their products. If people register the shareware programs they
   use, this will send a message to those talented programmers that
   a noble cause can be a viable way of life.

 Where to get new versions of PMSnap
 ------------------------------------
 When a new version of PMSnap comes out, the first thing we will do
 is send it to registered users. If you give us an (Internet) e-mail
 address when you register, we will e-mail the new PMSnap to you
 immediately.
 
 After we have finished sending copies to registered users, we will
 post a copy to ftp.cdrom.com on the Internet. PMSnap will be put
 in the /pub/os2/incoming directory initially; after a while, it
 will be moved to the /pub/os2/2_x/graphics directory.

 Since this version of PMSnap is shareware, you are permitted
 (and encouraged) to pass on the file PMSnap??.ZIP. You may NOT 
 modify this file (or its individual components) before passing it on.
 Distributors may charge small fees for download time or distribution
 media, but may not under any circumstances charge anything for PMSnap
 itself.

 Why we wrote PMSnap
 --------------------
 I needed a good screen capture program for documentation purpose.
 Since nobody had yet implemented a good enough screen capture program
 with *good* Palette Manager support, I decided to implement my own.
 
 History
 --------
 PMSnap was first intended for our own use only, but since it seemed
 to be quite useful, we decided to add features and make it public.
 I started the task on my own, but soon realized I needed Peters
 expertise in palette management and clipboard handling.
