"the best" screen capture application for OS/2, year 1994

It has been a while since I used OS/2 and even longer since I wrote any OS/2 code... PMVDesk, a virtual desktop application, was something I wrote as for my C-studies at the university in early 1990. However it was quite fun, so I did do a little more than needed to get my C-course accepted ;-)
I did develop a "Pro" version including a visual virtual desktop with small windows. However it newer passed my quality checks and I newer released it. 
I also developed "the best" screen capture application for OS/2 called PMSnap. It not only captures the visible desktop, it also captures all virtual desktops and makes a huge screen capture as one big picture with the whole visible and virtual deskops. My friend, Peter Nielsen (author of PMView), helped me with the graphics part of the PMSnap code. Peter has given his consent to publish the code.

The code and documentation is published with GNU v3 licence, as is, without modifications, as it was in year 1994.
